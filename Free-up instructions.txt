How to use:

Open the app. It has two text boxes & one button. 

The first text box says "dive path here" 
In this box type the path of folder which has all the 
original & duplicate files.

If you dont know the address then simply open a file in
that location & goto its properties. There you can see the 
path, copy it. 

The second box says "extension here"
Type the extension of file which you wish to delete in this box
In our case we want to delete image files so the extension 
can be .jpg .jpeg or .png
If you dont know the extension then select the file & goto its 
properties there you can see the extension under "Type of file"
option (E.g. "BMP File (.bmp)" here .bmp is your extension) 

NOTE 1: 
  Be very cautious while typing extension. It should start 
  with a dot & should not have any spelling mistake. Also it is 
  case sensitive so .jpg is not same as .JPG
  Its a good idea to copy location & extension from properties.

After this just press the "Delete Copies" button.

NOTE 2:
  Wait till the software shows a message that says
  "Deleted all Copies". 
  Do not open or close the files of location or the app may
  crash. Once you see the message "Deleted all Copies" then 
  you are safe.

Not to worry if anything goes wrong. You can restore it from the
Recycle Bin.
